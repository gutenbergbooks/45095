<h2 class="sans">CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p>"The enemy is not yet subdued," announced the
<span class="smcap">Kaiser</span> in his New Year's address to his
troops. It is gratifying to have this rumour confirmed from a source
so unimpeachable.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Buelow</span> is finding himself <i>de
trop</i> at Rome. "Man wants but little here,
<span class="smcap">Buelow</span>," he is being told.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Stick it!" it may be remembered, was General
<span class="smcap">von Kluck's</span> Christmas message as published
in a German newspaper. The journal in question is evidently read in
Constantinople, for the Turks are now stated to have sent several
thousand sacks of cement to the Egyptian frontier with which to fill
up the Suez Canal.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>After all, it is pointed out, there is not very much difference
between the reigning Sultan of <span class="smcap">Turkey</span> and
his predecessor. The one is The Damned, and the other The Doomed.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>With reference to the "free fight" between Austrians and Germans
in the concentration camp at Pietermaritzburg, which Reuter reported
the other day, we now hear that the fight was not entirely free.
Several of the combatants, it seems, were afterwards fined.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The latest English outrage, according to Berlin, was done upon the
German officer who attempted to escape in a packing-case. It is said
that he has been put back in his case, which has been carefully
soldered up, and then as carefully mislaid.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Another typical German lie is published by the <i>Frankfurter
Zeitung</i>. Describing the <span class="smcap">First Lord</span> this
sheet says:&mdash;"Well built, he struts about elegantly dressed...." Those
who remember our <span class="smcap">Winston's</span> little porkpie
hat will resent this charge.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>An awfully annoying thing has happened to the <i>Vossische
Zeitung</i>. Our enterprising little contemporary asked three Danish
professors to state in what way they were indebted to German science,
and they all gave wrong answers. They said they were also indebted to
English science.</p>

"HOUNDS IN A WORKHOUSE."</p>
<p class="author1"><i>Daily Mail.</i></p>

<p>It was, of course, inevitable that the hunts should suffer through
the war.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><i>The Evening Standard</i> has been making enquiries as to the
effect of the War on the membership of the various Clubs. The report
from the Athen&aelig;um was "The War has not affected the club at
all." Can it be that the dear old fellows have not heard of it
yet?</p>

<p>"Business as usual" is evidently Paraguay's motto. They are having
one of their revolutions there in spite of the War.</p>

<p>The Tate Gallery authorities have now placed the pictures they
value most in the cellars of that institution, and the expression on
the face of any artist who finds his work still on the wall is in
itself a picture.</p>

<h2 class="sans">UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER.</h2>

<p class="title1">No. XIII.</p>

<p class="author">(<i>From Grand Admiral <span class="smcap">von
Tirpitz</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All Gracious Lord</span>,&mdash;It is no pleasant
life in these days to be a sailor, especially if one happens to be an
Admiral responsible for the organisation and direction of a great
Fleet. This morning, for instance, just as I was drinking my early cup
of coffee there comes me in my servant bearing a letter: "Will your
Excellency have it now?" he says, "or will you wait till you have
gathered more strength as the morning goes on?" and with that the old
sea-dog smiles a just perceptible smile.</p>

<p>"Is it from &mdash;&mdash;?" I say, leaving out the name.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answers, "it is from &mdash;&mdash;. It is the seventh in three
days. It will assuredly be some pleasant wish for the New Year. The
Lord Great Admiral is, indeed, fortunate in having so high a
well-wisher. I myself have no such luck, being only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is enough," I say, for I knew that he was about to tell me once
more that he was only a poor orphan and that his wife's temper being
of a bitter complaining nature had driven him from his home many years
ago. It is a long story and he spares not the smallest detail in
telling it, nay, rather he takes delight in showing how, in spite of
his own worthiness, destiny has with express malice singled him out
from his fellows to be trodden upon at all those moments when he had a
right to look for ease and enjoyment. This morning I was in no humour
to listen to it, so I ordered him to lay the letter down and to go
about his business. When he had departed I opened the letter, which
was a useless proceeding, for I already knew it was from your
all-highest Self, and, without reading it, I could have written down
its contents word for word. Notwithstanding this, I received the
letter and read it with the respect that is due to such a
communication, and I now proceed in all humility to answer it.</p>

<p>And first I will tell your Majesty that what you ask I cannot
promise to do. You want me to provoke a fleet action under the best
conditions so that we may be sure of smashing up the British and
securing eternal glory for ourselves. These things are, no doubt,
splendid, but they are not done by waving a wand. In securing
conditions the enemy also has something to say, especially when he is
much stronger than we are, so much so that, wherever we can put one
ship, he can put at least two ships of equal power. And sailors have
to consider the sea, the wind, the fog and a thousand other things
that the landsman cannot understand. To bombard Scarborough and Whitby
and to kill women and children may be all very well for once in a way,
but even for that once it was not so glorious a feat that your Majesty
will wish to inscribe it amongst the battle-honours of our Navy. I may
whisper to your Majesty, moreover, that in face of a brave and
resourceful foe these showy excursions are not without risk, and it
was only by the skin of their teeth that your ships escaped into home
waters after they had flung their shells into the two undefended
coast-towns.</p>

<p>Next, you want your foreign commerce restored. I cannot do that. It
is a misfortune of war that if your enemy has a bigger fleet he can
wipe away your foreign trade. If your Majesty did not wish it to be so
it would have been better not to go to war. I presume your Majesty
couldn't wait, lest the Russians should construct strategic railways
and the French provide themselves with boots (which I understand they
have now procured in great quantities), but there it is; and after all
we might not have been better off for waiting, since these English
rascals showed a most bloodthirsty determination always to have a
bigger Fleet than ours, no matter what we did. And so our poor
commerce must have disappeared in any case. For an Empire like ours
that is, I am informed, a great misfortune, though, for my own part,
it has not hitherto affected me. On the other hand the scattering of
ships like the <i>Emden</i> and <span class="smcap">von Spee's</span>
squadron, in order to destroy the enemy's commerce has only led to one
conclusion, and that has been the bottom of the sea. All this is
vexing, but it must be endured, and an occasional success with a
submarine, though agreeable at the moment, does not substantially
alter it.</p>

<p>Finally, as to the Russian Fleet, how, I ask, can we be expected to
gain a victory over ships which hide themselves away in the Baltic in
so mean a manner, and show no desire for the delight of battle? They
have no consciousness of the fact that war-ships were intended for
warfare.</p>

<p>Your Majesty is good enough to impute blame to me. Some part of
this, I do not doubt, belongs to me. The rest, as is right, I will
pass on to poor old <span class="smcap">Ingenohl</span> and to Prince
<span class="smcap">Henry</span>, and shall ask them to guess whence
it originally came.</p>

yesterday, were greatly aided by the fact that, before going into
action, they had burnt-corked their faces. The effect upon the
<i>moral</i> of the enemy was disastrous, the terrified troops flying
in confusion.</p>

<hr class="mid"  />

<p>The 1914 conscripts, who, as is well known, have yet to go into
action, must not be supposed to be lying idle; they are being rendered
irresistible by a severe training in the use of the grimace, which is
likely to take the place of the bayonet as a means of clearing enemy
trenches. The <span class="smcap">Crown Prince</span> himself has
frequently given instruction to the troops, although, in the interests
of the men, it has been found necessary for the demonstrations to be
carried on through sheets of smoked glass.</p>

<hr class="mid" />

<p><span class="smcap">Krupps</span> have largely abandoned the
manufacture of big guns, and have now laid down plant for the
construction of five million masks of a hideousness without parallel.
Samples tested by the Black Pomeranians prove that any one of these
masks has the power to drive a force of a thousand men into instant
and complete insensibility.</p>

<hr class="mid" />

<p>With regard to the new crop reports, it must be remembered that
fields hitherto intended for the growing of wheat and barley have,
under a new order from the Imperial War Department, been planted with
roots for the manufacture of the terrifying turnip-ghosts now required
by the German army.</p>

<h2 class="sans">THE LAST LINE.</h2>

<p class="title1">VI.</p>

<p>Our uniform&mdash;or, if that is too military a word, our academical
costume&mdash;is officially announced to be "grey-green," the colour of the
sea at 7.30 in the morning, when you decide that you have forgotten
your towel and had better have a hot bath quietly at home. I don't
know how invisible we shall be as soldiers, but anchored off the
Maplin Sands we should deceive anybody. Where are the Buoys of the Old
Brigade? Ah, where indeed! Even as marines we should have our
value.</p>

<p>Luckily, we have been practising amphibious warfare for some time.
The camp is mostly under water, and when the "Fall-in" is sounded we
do it quite easily. The "Emerge" is not so easily obeyed. But there
were drier days in December, and on one of these I made a curious
discovery.</p>

<p>We were having a field-day, and my side of the battle was advancing
in sections under shell-fire over fairly flat country. Every now and
then, however, we came to a small hill or group of hills. There seemed
to be no human reason for it, and I suggested to my section that we
were on the track of some new kind of mole.</p>

<p>"No," said James, "those are bunkers."</p>

<p>We looked at each anxiously and tapped our foreheads.</p>

<p>"It's a golf-course," he persisted.</p>

<p>I could not allow dangerous talk of this kind to go on.</p>

<p>"Silence in the ranks," I said sternly.</p>

<p>A little later, when we were halted, an old, old man, the Nestor
of the section, asked if he might speak to me.</p>

<p>"Certainly, my lad," I said.</p>

<p>"I think he du be right," he said, indicating James; "I've heerd
tell on 'un. Great-great-grandfayther used to play."</p>

<p>Another man said that he had seen an old print of the game in a
shop, but he thought it was called Ludo.</p>

<p>And then, in a most curious way, I had the sudden feeling that I
myself had played the game in some previous existence&mdash;when I was a
king in Babylon, perhaps, and James was a Christian caddie. It was
most odd. When we got back to camp, I spoke to him about it.</p>

<p>"On Boxing Day, James," I whispered, "one might pursue one's
researches in this matter. I should like to find out the truth about
it. We might meet at&mdash;&mdash;h'r'm! To the left, to two paces,
ex-<i>tend!</i>" I added this loudly for the benefit of our platoon
commander who was passing, and James (who in ordinary life extends two
paces to the front) withdrew slowly into the darkness.</p>

<p>I won't refer to what happened on Boxing Day; one does not talk
about these things. But I must tell you of its unfortunate
sequel.</p>

<p>Last week, in the course of a route-march, we were suddenly turned
on to distance-judging. I had never done this before, and a remote and
lonely tree, half-hidden in the mist, conveyed nothing definite to
me.</p>

<p>"What do you think?" I asked James.</p>

<p>"A drive and a mashie, about."</p>

<p>"S'sh," I said warningly. However, I determined to act on the
suggestion. Remembering Boxing Day I allowed eighty yards for James's
drive, and thirty-five for a mashie off the socket. Total, 115. It
looked more, but the mist was deceptive. However, when the results
were read out, the distance was given as 385 yards, and James, if you
please, had said 350!</p>

<p>Let us leave this painful subject and turn to signalling. We are
getting a little more proficient. Every message we send now starts
properly with prefix, service instructions, code time, and so on, and
the message itself gets in as many hyphens, horizontal lines,
fractions and inverted commas as possible. Here, for instance, is the
beginning of a thrilling message (sent to the Editor of <i>The
Times</i>) which I was receiving last Sunday.</p>

<p>"Fore-warned being fore-armed Lieut. Z. SMITHSON, 21st Foot on the
<i>Przemysl-Rzeszow-Olkusz</i> road, with &pound;3 9<i>s.</i>
7&frac12;<i>d.</i> in his pocket (interest on 5&frac12;% DEBENTURES at
97&mdash;brokerage 1/8th) proceeded at 9.25 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>
to &mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this point the "Fall-in" sounded and we had to stop. I never
heard what happened to Lieut. Smithson. My own theory is that he
murdered Emma and put the blame on Lt.-Col. St. George, D. S. O., who
only had three-and-a-half per cents, and had never seen the girl
before. Perhaps the matter will be cleared up when the War is
over.</p>

<p>But it was a sad blow to us to be told in a lecture that same
afternoon that despatch-riding has proved to be much more useful than
signalling at the Front. It had an immediate effect on James, and the
advertisement in <i>The Times</i> beginning
"<span class="smcap">Wanted to Exchange</span> a pair of
blue-and-white silk flags (new) for motor-bicycle," is generally
supposed to be his.</p>

<p>"And all the time I've spent on signalling has been wasted," he
said indignantly.</p>

<p>"Not wasted, James. Your silhouette as you signalled an 'i' has
made many a wet day bright. Anyway, it's no excuse for not coming to
bayonet drill. That won't be wasted."</p>

<p>James made some absurd excuse about wanting to improve his shooting
first.</p>

<p>"One is more independent with the bayonet," I assured him. "The
Government doesn't like us as it is, and it's not going to waste much
ammunition on us. But once you've tied the carving-knife on to the end
of your umbrella, there you are."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll think about it," said James.</p>

<p>But I have heard since that he had already attended one class; and
that in the middle of it James the solicitor advised James the soldier
not to proceed further with the matter.</p>

<p>"Your time," said James the solicitor, "will be better spent on the
range&mdash;where you can lie down."</p>

<p>And James the soldier made it so.</p>

Yellow Book, Blue Book, White Book, Orange Book and Grey Book</i>]</p>

<p class="indent1">&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>From Alfred Midgely, Office Manager, to James Henry
Bullivant (Managing Director of Bullivants, Limited, Drysalters),
temporarily abroad.</i></p>

<p>I hear from an absolutely trustworthy source that our town
traveller, Mr. Herbert Blenkins, is thinking of giving notice. I have
the honour to suggest that this merits the immediate attention of Your
Excellency.</p>

<p class="indent1">&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>From J. H. B. to A. M.</i></p>

<p>Blenkins cannot be allowed to leave at this juncture. You should
make a <i>d&eacute;marche</i> towards the Office Boy, endeavour to
ascertain from him whether <i>pourparlers</i> might not be opened with
the Senior Typist in the direction of her using her influence with the
Book-keeper to learn whether Blenkins' purpose is in the nature of an
ultimatum or a <i>ballon d'essai</i>.</p>

<p class="indent1">&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>From A. M. to J. H. B.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Blenkins has presented his note. I have the honour to enclose a
copy. The Office Boy is absent for a few days attending the obsequies
of his grandmother. I have telegraphed to his home in the sense of
your despatch. No reply has come, and I have the honour to await Your
Excellency's further orders.</p>

<p class="indent1">&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>From J. H. B. to A. M.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span></p>
<p>It is imperative that there should be no delay in this matter. You
should obtain the address of the office-boy's grandfather, and call
upon him to learn whether he will agree to exert his grandparental
influence in the direction already outlined.</p>

<p class="indent1">&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>From J. H. B. to Uncle Edward, Brother Theodore
and Cousin Bob, co-Directors.</i></p>

<p>I enclose copies of correspondence relative to the Blenkins'
crisis, which is rapidly assuming a gravity which I cannot affect to
view with indifference. I beg you to proceed immediately to Midgely,
and support his endeavours with the united weight of your diplomatic
abilities.</p>

<p class="indent1">&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>From A. M. to J. H. B.</i></p>

<p>I learn from a sure source that the Office-Boy's grandmother has
already died three times. The grandfather is alleged to be <i>non
compos mentis</i>. Mr. Blenkins is mobilising his office papers. This
is highly significant.</p>

<p class="indent1">&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>From A. M. to J. H. B.</i></p>

<p>Further to my despatch of this morning, I have the honour to report
that Mr. Robert Bullivant suggests that we should offer Mr. Blenkins
another twenty pounds a year and have done with it. Mr. Theodore
Bullivant is firmly opposed to any diplomatic weakness at this
juncture, in view of possible demands from the Book-keeper, whom we
suspect of a secret <i>entente</i> with Mr. Blenkins. Your
Excellency's uncle demands peace at any price. Should I take the
unprecedented step of making a direct approach to Mr. Blenkins?</p>

<p class="indent1">&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>From J. H. B. to A. M.</i></p>

<p>No. The resources of Diplomacy must first be exhausted. In view of
the urgency of the crisis, I authorise you to pass over the Office
Boy and open <i>pourparlers</i> with the Senior Typist with a view to
obtaining a <i>mise en demeure</i> from Blenkins.</p>

<p class="indent1">&nbsp;&nbsp;9.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>From A. M. to J. H. B.</i></p>

<p>The Senior Typist has met with a reverse from an experimental
hair-dye, and will not be visible for a week.</p>

<p class="indent1">10.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>From J. H. B. to A. M.</i></p>

<p>Approach the Book-keeper.</p>

<p class="indent1">11.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>From A. M. to J. H. B.</i></p>

<p>I have the honour to surmise that no definite purpose will be
achieved through the diplomatic channel of the Book-keeper. He states
that he prefers to keep himself to himself. Mr. Blenkins has already
asked for his office cuffs, and a final severance of relations is
imminent. I have not yet handed him his cuffs, which I have ventured
to sequestrate on the ground that they are spotted with our ink.</p>

<p class="indent1">12.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>From J. H. B. to A. M.</i></p>

<p>Retain the cuffs pending diplomatic action from Mr. Theodore.</p>

<p class="indent1">13.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>From J. H. B. to Brother Theodore.</i></p>

<p>I enclose copies of correspondence relative to Blenkins' attempt to
claim possession of our ink-spots. If in your opinion this constitutes
a <i>casus belli</i>, I beg you to approach him with such menaces as
are not inconsistent with the continuance of diplomatic relations.</p>

<p class="indent1">14.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>From T. B. to J. H. B.</i></p>

<p>In view of the gravity of the crisis, I have taken legal opinion.
If the cuffs were not only spotted with our ink, but were also clipped
with our scissors, then they are <i>ipso facto</i> and <i>ad hoc</i>
to be considered as neutral territory within the meaning of the
Statutes of International Office Law.</p>

<p class="indent1">15.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>From J. H. B. to A. M.</i></p>

<p>You should immediately ascertain, through the proper channels, if
and (or) when and (or) how Blenkins clipped the cuffs. In the
meantime you will convey to him that we should not be disposed to view
with indifference any attempt on his part to violate the frontiers of
neutral territory.</p>

<p class="indent1">16.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>From A. M. to J. H. B.</i></p>

<p>Blenkins has gone!</p>

<h2 class="sans">ALONZO.</h2>

<p>It was a bright Monday morning in September, and I was doing my
usual patter dance in the dressing-room, striving to defeat the
time-table&mdash;ten minutes for breakfast and five minutes to get to the
station.</p>

<p>I dipped hurriedly into the collar-drawer, drew one forth, inverted
it, cast a tie (Wadham Wanderers, E. team) into the parting and
proceeded to secure the arrangement. The back stud operated without
comment, but when I came to the front there seemed to be an inch or
two of collar missing. At first I looked at it with mild surprise,
then the horrible truth flashed through me.</p>

<p>I dashed into Joe's room.</p>

<p>"Look here," I exclaimed, "just look at my neck!"</p>

<p>Joe looked at it carefully for quite a minute.</p>

<p>"Yes," she remarked, "I think there is a tiny spot under the left
ear. You've been drilling too much. You've been dressing too much to
the left."</p>

<p>"No! No!" I shouted, tugging at the collar, "can't you see how
swollen it is? It's that complaint you get from drinking chalky water.
It's all your fault! I've told you hundreds of times to put a marble
in the kettle."</p>

<p>Joe unfastened the collar, looked at it and laughed.</p>

<p>I snatched it back.</p>

<p>Inside there was a brief summary: "Alonzo. Fourfold.
14&frac12;."</p>

<p>I take 16.</p>

<p>"That," said Joe, pointing to Alonzo, "must be the extra collar
they sent from the laundry last week."</p>

<p>It was. Alonzo was a gift&mdash;a donation. Sleek, youthful and
unsullied, he came to us, bringing an air of tragedy into the
home.</p>

<p>Three times during that week I tried to soil his glossy coat, and
each time a golden minute was shorn from my breakfast. After that I
put him in the sock drawer.</p>

<p>At the end of the first week I said to Joe, "Alonzo is bored, the
society of half-hose does not interest him. Send him home."</p>

<p>He was sent, and my wardrobe settled itself peacefully.</p>

<p>On the following Monday I dipped into the collar drawer, went
through the usual rites, and&mdash;&mdash;No, it didn't really startle me. He
had returned.</p>

<p>I put him in the sock drawer again.</p>

<p>Evidently he had plans of his own. One week at the laundry and one
week at "Sunnyside," alternating, as it were, between taking the
waters and a rest cure.</p>

<p>I began to respect Alonzo, but at the same time I felt he must be
shown that there is such a thing as authority. I put him in a
cardboard box, addressed it myself, posted it myself, and wrote to the
manager myself. You think that settled him? You do not know Alonzo. He
is made of sterner stuff than that.</p>

<p>At the end of the week he was back again, well and cheerful. Coming
of a resourceful and determined race we tried other means&mdash;I forget
how many&mdash;of outing him. Once the manager took him away in a taxi and
once our Ann consigned him to the ash-pit.</p>

<p>It was no good. We had to give it up. We adopted him. As I write,
Alonzo rests in <i>his</i> sock drawer, slightly fatigued but
indomitable.</p>

<p>Peter's birthday is soon after Xmas, too soon after for Peter's
taste&mdash;and mine.</p>

<p>"I want one or two good War Games," I said to the attendant at the
toymonger's. "What have you got?"</p>

<p>"Several, Sir," she said. "Here is one, 'The North Sea Battle.'
Made in London."</p>

<p>She opened a box containing realistic wooden models, in
silhouette, of two battleships, two cruisers and two destroyers
correctly coloured; a grey and grim-looking breech-loading gun with
wooden projectiles, a gun embrasure and a small rule labelled "one
mile." Every ship carried the White Ensign and my heart warmed to them
at sight.</p>

<p>"Tell me the worst at once," I said, pulling out some loose
silver.</p>

<p>"Two-and-eleven," she said.</p>

<p>"Sold in two places," I said; "I mean I'll have two of them without
reading the rules."</p>

<p>"Here," she said, fingering another box, "is the 'Siege of
Berlin.'"</p>

<p>"Intelligent anticipation," I said, "at any rate."</p>

<p>"Quite so," she said, "Made in London, too, by the same
people."</p>

<p>I liked the idea of besieging Berlin, and when the open box
disclosed a Rathhaus, churches, houses and other buildings, and a
breach-loading gun similar to the one last before mentioned, to
demolish the buildings with, I forked out another five-and-tenpence,
and became the possessor of two "Sieges of Berlin."</p>

<p>I despatched one "Siege" and one "North Sea Battle" to some Belgian
refugee children I know, and took the others home to Peter.</p>

<p>We tried the sea-fight first, Peter electing to play the part of

the embrasure and tried to prevent the ships from reaching my
cardboard fastness by knocking them over <i>en route</i>. I found
that, every time I missed, the whole Fleet was entitled to advance one
mile&mdash;in reality about six inches&mdash;nearer my fort. The ships were
provided with rockers and came up smiling if not squarely hit.</p>

<p>Long before my allowance of shot was expended, the British Fleet
was upon me, and I metaphorically hoisted the white flag.</p>

<p>"Come," I said, as Peter set up the Rathhaus and other buildings
of Berlin, "my heart is in this. How do we play?"</p>

<p>"Three shots each," said Peter, "and you score what's marked on
the back of each building you knock down. I'll go first."</p>

<p>Peter's first shot was a miss. With his second he brought down a
house which fell against a fort, knocking it over too. His third shot
sailed harmlessly over the town and landed in the fender.</p>

<p>"How many?" I said.</p>

<p>"Twenty," said Peter. "Not bad."</p>

<p>"Keep your eye on father," I said, training the gun on the
Rathhaus. I managed to conceal my surprise when the building fell at
the first attempt.</p>

<p>"I shall knock you endways," I said.</p>

<p>The second shot hit the fallen Rathhaus, so I shifted the muzzle
of the gun a little to the left. The buildings seemed well bunched
together at this point.</p>

<p>It was a magnificent shot; the projectile skimmed past the church
steeple as well-regulated shells should do, without damaging it, and
swept away two buildings immediately behind it.</p>

<p>"That's some shooting," I said. "How many am I?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Peter.</p>

<p>"Look here, young man," I said, "explain yourself. First the
Rathhaus."</p>

<p>"That's five," said Peter, "because it's so big and easy to
hit."</p>

<p>I hadn't thought of that.</p>

<p>"Then there's this house&mdash;ten," said Peter.</p>

<p>"Come, we're getting on," I said. "That's fifteen; and now&mdash;this
bigger house."</p>

<p>"Minus fifteen," said Peter. "That's the Red Cross Hospital. Oh,
Daddy, you Hun!"</p>

<h2 class="sans">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="title">(Extracted from the Diary of Toby, M.P.)</p>

<p><i>House of Lords, Wednesday, January 6th.</i>&mdash;Judging from public
form, few would imagine that Lord <span class="smcap">Kitchener of
Khartoum</span> is a wag. Versatility in this direction triumphantly
vindicated this afternoon. On approach to Christmas, House of Commons,
after exceptionally long and arduous Session, adjourned till first
week in February. That all very well for a frivolous miscellaneous
assemblage. Under vigorous leadership of dominant opposition by Lord
<span class="smcap">Curzon</span>, Peers resolved to set example of
higher devotion to public interest. Regardless of private convenience,
arranged special sitting opening to-day.</p>

<p>Procedure unprecedented. Not unusual for Commons to sit while Lords
make holiday. In long course of Parliamentary history contrary course
unknown.</p>

<p>Some embarrassment at first in face of persistent questioning as to
Why and Wherefore. Last week official explanation forthcoming.
Announcement made that House was summoned primarily with intention of
providing <span class="smcap">Secretary of State for War</span> with
opportunity of making important statement as to actual situation and
immediate prospects of the war.</p>

<p>This quite reasonable, indeed very desirable.  Country growing
increasingly impatient at being kept in the dark as to the progress of
affairs in Flanders on the plea of military necessity for
secretiveness. Now <span class="smcap">Kitchener</span>, provided with
exceptional opportunity, would sweep away all clouds of doubt and
ignorance. Of course with due reticence in hearing of the enemy, would
take into his confidence the common people who provide blood and money
for carrying on the gigantic struggle.</p>

<p>In anticipation of this lifting of the veil House crowded in
measure reached only at great political crises. As usual on such
occasions, side galleries flecked with Peeresses. But what ominous
change in their appearance! The gay colours of other times are changed
for monotony of deepest mourning. Black is the only wear.</p>

<p>K. of K. rose promptly on the stroke of half-past four, when public
business is entered upon. Producing a bundle of MS. he bent his head
over it and proceeded at the double to get through it. Noble Lords
behind him and on back benches opposite found it difficult to follow
the story.</p>

<p>Gradually point of little joke dawned upon them. Here were the
benches thronged with expectant Peers, and all the world listening at
the door for a message. That all very natural. But it was not an
affair of K.'s initiative or arrangement. He was expected to make a
speech, and it is a soldier's duty to obey orders. But if any supposed
he was going to be more communicative than is the fashion established
under the rule of the Censor they would find themselves sharply
undeceived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span></p>
<p>Turning to survey the Western theatre of the War, he remarked,
"During the month of December the Allied Forces have made progress at
various points." Chilling silence following upon enunciation of this
familiar generality, he added, "The tide of battle has ebbed and
flowed with varying success to either side." Facing about to view the
situation Eastward, he informed noble Lords that "in East Prussia the
situation has undergone but little change.... In the Caucasus, the end
of November [six weeks ago] the Turkish Army was being pushed back
towards Erzerum." Later, the House heard with startled amazement that
"On our own coasts, on the morning of December 16, German battle
cruisers bombarded for half-an-hour Hartlepool, Scarborough, and
Whitby."</p>

<p>As to progress of recruiting, with respect to which information was
looked forward to with exceptional interest, he went so far as to say,
"Recruiting has proceeded on normal lines."</p>

<p>"The noble lord," said the <span class="smcap">Leader of the
Opposition</span>, amid a murmur of assent from the dumbfounded
Peers, "has been very economical in his information," a really
delicate way of stating the fact.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;None.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Lords adjourned.</p>

<h2>INDIAN INTELLIGENCE.</h2>

<p class="title1"><i>Vi&acirc;</i> <span class="sc">Berlin</span>.</p>

<p>The following extracts from official despatches exchanged between
General von Funkinstein and the German Great General Staff have been
communicated to us by a wholly impeachable authority, and are
published with no reserve whatever:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;From the General Officer Commanding, &amp;c.:&mdash;</p>

<p>"... with regard to various recent regrettable incidents in which
sections of the Imperial trenches have been captured by native troops
from British India (which, according to the German official programme,
ought to have been in revolt long since) some light has now been cast
upon the probable reason for this. Used as we now are to the contempt
for every rule of civilized warfare displayed by our detestable and
cowardly adversary, this new revelation of his cunning and brutality
will nevertheless come as a shock.</p>

<p>"Aircraft observation has now made it clear that the force
immediately opposed to my command is not the &mdash;&mdash; Horse, as was
believed, but a picked body of the First Indian Jugglers, specially
recruited for this campaign. On the occasion of the last attack we
were startled about 5.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> by a
prodigious and ear-splitting noise proceeding from the trenches
occupied by these troops&mdash;or troupes. Perhaps no soldiers in the world
save our own incomparable warriors, trained to withstand modern German
music, could have endured this ghastly din without flinching. Before
long we observed a confused and stealthy movement on our front; but
what was our emotion to see advancing out of the mist not the expected
native charge, but a double line of trained cobras. Despite the
inevitable shock produced by this discovery, energetic steps were at
once taken to deal with the attack, and a brisk fire was opened with
hand grenades. The results were however negligible, from the fact that
the reptiles, apparently mistaking the hissing of the fuses for a
challenge from others of their own species, instantly and savagely bit
them off, thus rendering the grenades ineffective. Under these
circumstances I had no alternative but to evacuate my position, a
movement that was accomplished in fair order and very creditable time,
myself leading..."</p>

<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;Extract from copy of reply by Chief of Great General Staff,
Berlin:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am commanded by H.I.M. to inform you that you must retake
trenches at once, regardless of loss. Reports of scandalous breach of
all civilised laws forwarded to Presidents Geneva Convention and Hague
Tribunal. Two reserve battalions of Guards leave Potsdam to-night.
Hope that an accentuated mongoose-step movement may crush the new
enemy. Please report at once."</p>

<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;From Same as No. 1:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Regret to convey further unfavourable development with regard to
our operations against the Jugglers' Corps. Having tempted a large
body of these into open country some distance to the rear of our
original lines, I ordered an attack in what should have been
overwhelming force. The enemy was at this stage entirely exposed to
our fire, being without any possibility of cover. Unfortunately, just
as we had them at our mercy, a concerted movement by their entire
strength, known (I believe) as the Mango Trick, resulted in the
appearance of a dense grove of these trees, behind which the enemy is
at present effectually screened."</p>

<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;From the same:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Our treacherous foe has again escaped us. An heroic attack by the
bayonet upon the Mango Grove mentioned in previous despatch was
successful in capturing the position, but only in time to see the last
unit of the defending force vanishing up a rope, which with a large
number of others was dangling without visible attachment. The effect
of this renewed failure upon the <i>moral</i> of the Imperial army has
unfortunately been considerable. I learn from my agents that the enemy
is now bringing up a number of heavy hypnotists for use against me
personally. Please wire instructions."</p>

<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;From the same as (2):&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your resignation on the ground of ill-health regretfully accepted.
Return at once."</p>

<h2 class="sans">THE WATCH DOGS.</h2>

<p class="title1">XI.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Charles</span>,&mdash;When you have
witnessed a military inspection, have seen the Great Man going round
the companies and have heard his few kind words to the victims of his
scrutiny, no doubt you have told yourself that a soldier's life must
be very smooth and comfortable and his work as easy as kiss-my-hand.
If further you assume, from the clock-like regularity of the parade,
that we must all be on very good terms and intimate understanding with
each other, I feel bound to disclose the dismal facts.</p>

<p>The information that we were to be inspected by our Great Man on
the Friday was handed to me, with the soup, at Thursday's mess. I did
not appreciate its horrible significance and, wondering why it should
put the older hands off their ration beef, I ate my dinner in the
usual manner, cracked a jest or two with the slightly preoccupied
Adjutant and C.O., and later on strolled down to my company's billet
to inform them that they would be inspected on the morrow. I supposed
they would say to each other, "Oh! indeed," and turn in to sleep; but
I am credibly informed that they had no bed that night.</p>

<p>On the following morning I was dumbfounded by their dazzling
appearance and could not help remarking that here at last was the
Perfect Thing. I was just sufficiently soldierlike, however, to
examine them with an icy disdain before we set out. <i>En route</i> to
the rendezvous, I pictured to myself the Great Man's delight at
beholding us, his superlative admiration expressed in a voice choked
with affectionate emotion, and his final jocular farewell to
myself&mdash;"As for <i>your</i> company, my dear Henry, it's
marvellous."</p>

<p>I cannot record the actual event in all its details, which were
mostly bootlaces and whiskers. The first I knew of the trouble was a
face so ominous as to divert attention even from a splendid uniform.
Such was the look in the inspecting eye that, had I been my own
master, I should have bowed as lowly as to Allah, and said, "Your
Highness, I regret that urgent business at the Bank compels the
instant departure of myself (with my company)," and we should have
been gone at the double before he had gathered the gist of my remark.
As it was, I had to stand fast and pretend that we were all very glad
to see him and hoped he would make a long stay with us.</p>

<p>At about the third man, he stopped dead, very dead, and called my
attention to the fact that this private was all whiskers and no
bootlaces. What had I to say to that? I might have said, "So he is,
Sir, now I come to look at him. He should, of course, have been all
boot-laces and no whisker," or merely, "Well, I never!" or, again,
with some truth, "As to his laces, Sir, they were there a minute ago
but have just fallen out of his boots; and the hair has all grown on
his face while you and I were saluting each other just now." Instead
I was mute by the visitation of Heaven and we passed on, to pause at
No. 8, whose feet and face also were by now all that they should not
be.</p>

<p>Again, I was called upon for a speech&mdash;in vain. You will notice,
Charles, that Brigadiers and Colonels are poltroons at these times;
they push the company-commander into the forefront of the battle and
skulk behind his back.</p>

<p>The Great Man interrupted his examination to chat with his A.D.C.,
mainly, I fancy, about whiskers and bootlaces. Being also interested
in the subject, I took the opportunity to look along my company and
see (believe me or not, as you please) the whiskers coming into
existence and the laces going out.... I gathered later that things
were much the same with every company in the brigade. The Brigadier
gathered this also, but at once and from the Great Man.</p>

<p>That night the Brigadier sent for our C.O. The next morning our
C.O. sent for us. In due sequence we sent for our section-commanders,
and what was left of them, when we had finished, went to interview the
private. The last-named, having no one to whom to express his
contempt, utter loathing and devilish intentions for the future,
adopted the only alternative and took the necessary action.</p>

<p>The news of a second inspection reached me a week in advance,
during which I took no food because I was left no time and had no
appetite. It was a gloomy period, which was relieved only by two small
incidents. The one took place at the C.O.'s inspection, and I will
call it "The Private and the Toothbrush." Asked why it was so black,
he replied that he cleaned his teeth with permanganate of potash, thus
defeating the little crowd inspecting him, since none knew whether
that chemical could be used for cleaning teeth and, if it could,
whether it would turn the brush black. The other I will call "The
Memo. of the Transport Officer," who was so upset by what was said to
him that he "begged to certify that he had that day purchased 3 new
altars for his Transport service." This was officially passed on to me
to cheer me up a little, and I am authorised to divulge it to you.</p>

<p>The week elapsed in a hurricane of harsh oaths, and again I paraded
my company. Upon examination it now appeared to me to be the most
revoltingly untidy and deficient sight I had ever seen, an opinion
heartily endorsed by the Adjutant, C.O. and Brigadier. <i>En route</i>
to the rendezvous this time I pictured nothing to myself; I merely
shifted my service revolver to a position from which I could more
easily destroy myself in an emergency.... And when the Great Man
approached he smiled at me, and no sooner had he remarked to his
A.D.C. that the buttons and bayonets of the brigade did credit to all
concerned than those stolidly dull buttons of mine brightened up and
bayonets grew where before there had been empty and depressed
scabbards.</p>

<p>I don't know exactly what the Great Man said to the Brigadier, but
expect it was much the same as the C.O. said to us and we to the
section-commanders. I doubt if the section-commanders said anything
nice to the private, but no doubt the latter knew by instinct that
this was an occasion upon which he might with impunity, but only once
in a way, step slightly aside from the straight and narrow path. I
guess, my dear Charles, that it is only the <i>second</i> inspection
to which you, as representing the ignorant public, are invited.</p>

<p>The forty-eight hours' leave (by way of reward or for
convalescence) which ensued I spent with my wife. With feminine
perversity she at once started inspecting my moustache, one of the
most astonishing productions of these astonishing times. "Say what you
please now," said I, quite imperturbable. "At the next inspection
you'll find yourself remarking that it is the best disciplined and
equipped moustache you have ever seen." And so it is.</p>

<p class="indent2">
"YOU ENJOY FRESH AIR. YOU SEE THE LIFE OF THE TREES. YOU PASS EVERY

<p>Possibly the Tube will take its revenge and post the following

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span></p>

<hr />

<h2 class="sans">MY EWE LION.</h2>

<p>I must confess that I was finding it rather galling to have no
friends at all at the Front. Everyone else was so well furnished with
these acquaintances, often actually relations. But I had no one I
knew, although gradually one by one my clerks joined
<span class="smcap">Kitchener's</span> Army and passed to various
training grounds, returning (in my opinion far too often) to the
office in their uniforms to disturb the routine and waste the time of
the others. Some drilling and instruction I am assured go on in these
camps, but I see in London every day sufficient English soldiers to
drive twice the present number of Germans out of Belgium&mdash;if they
really meant it.</p>

<p>My point, however, is that for far too long there was no one at the
Front, either living, dead or wounded, with whom I could claim any
intimacy, and this is the kind of thing which does not do a man any
good on his way to and back from the City.</p>

<p>Everyone else in my morning and evening trains has had friends at
the Front ever since we sent out our first draft, and to me their talk
about them has been extremely galling. Some of them have even had
letters from them, and these are either read or paraphrased and have
enormously sent up the stock of the recipients. In fact several men
whom I know to be very shaky in business, and others who have been
rather blown upon on account of their general bounderish demeanour,
have established themselves in improved social positions wholly
through letters from the Front.</p>

<p>There are people, of course, who, not having a soldier friend,
would invent one; but that is not my way. I would not do that. For one
thing, I should have great difficulty in keeping it up. It would mean
studying the map, reading all the reports and knowing more about the
army than I have time to learn.</p>

<p>Imagine then my delight and excitement when I opened the evening
paper a day or so ago, and found that the hero of the dashing and
perilous feat of which everyone was talking, and which resulted in the
capture of many Germans and machine guns, was no other than the son of
my old friend Wargrave. I had not seen Wargrave for some years, but we
met often once, and on my last visit to him his son had been home from
school, and I now remembered how fine a lad I had thought him. He had
a fearless eye and a high spirit; he was, in fact, the very stuff of
which bold warriors are made. There was no doubt about his identity
either, for a personal paragraph in the paper stated who his father
was.</p>

<p>I was so pleased about it all that I sat down at once and wrote a
congratulatory note to Wargrave senior; and on my way to the station I
thought of other things in connection with his brave son which I might
never have called to mind but for this deed of prowess: what a good
appetite he had had; how he had climbed a tree for cherries; how he
had torn his clothes; and how tedious I had found his addiction to
what was called a water-pistol. "Good old Clifford!"&mdash;that was his
name. Lieut. Clifford Wargrave, I said to myself, and my heart beat
the faster for having known him.</p>

<p>That evening the only man that I knew in my carriage coming home
was Barrington, and naturally I said something to him about the
gallant son of my old friend. Barrington is not a man that I ever
liked, and my young people say contemptuous things of his family as a
whole. One of the daughters, however, is rather pretty, but I should
not care to confess this at my own table. It is as dangerous to tell
some girls about the prettiness of others as to tell some people that
they look well. Anyway, since Barrington was there, I mentioned to him
that it was gratifying to me to think that my old friend's son had
become such a public hero, and I recollected as I was talking, and
mentioned too, certain further incidents in the young fellow's
boyhood. We once bathed together in Cornwall, I remembered, and I am
not sure that it was not I who taught him to swim. At another time we
had been on a picnic and I had made him and his sister laugh a good
deal by my jokes&mdash;poor simple things, no doubt, but tickling to him.
"And no doubt he is the same simple fellow now," I said, "always ready
to laugh and be merry." I told Barrington also about the cherries and
the torn clothes, and what a good appetite he had; and about the
water-pistol.</p>

<p>"Odd to think that that boy should grow into a hero," I said. "How
little we can read the future!"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," said Barrington.</p>

<p>I don't know why, but talking about this young friend of long ago,
now so illustrious, to Barrington, made me quite to like the man, and
I even went out of my way to accompany him to his gate.</p>

<p>I am wiser now. I now know that it is a mistake ever to change
one's opinion of a man. And the extraordinary pettiness of human
nature! the paltry little varieties of it! the straws it will clutch
at to support its self-esteem!</p>

<p>The next morning, owing to some delay over breakfast, I was a
little late at the station and failed to get my usual seat among my
usual set. I managed just to scramble into a carriage and subsided
into the far corner with my paper well before my face because I did
not want to be sociable in that company. One has to be careful. Just
as the train started, in dashed Barrington and took the only seat
left&mdash;in fact there was not really room for him. He did not see
me.</p>

<p>The train had not left the station before one of the men remarked
upon the heroism of young Wargrave; when to my astonishment and
annoyance Barrington at once took him up.</p>

<p>"Ah! yes," he said. "Such a fine young fellow; I always knew he
would do something like that."</p>

<p>"Then you know him?" he was asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't say that I exactly know him," he said, "but I used
to hear a lot about him from one of the most intimate friends of the
family."</p>

<p>And one by one he told all my little anecdotes&mdash;trivial enough when
in the mouth of a stranger, but, coming from one who knew, interesting
and important. Will you believe it, Wargrave lasted Barrington and his
idiotic listeners all the way to London&mdash;my Wargrave, mind, not his at
all! And the way they listened! I personally sat hidden, and fumed but
said nothing. How could I suddenly claim Wargrave as my own without
being ridiculous? Nor would they have believed me. Besides, to put
myself in competition with Barrington....</p>

<p>I managed to elude Barrington's eye at the terminus, and sought my
office in a state of fury and contempt. At lunch I was again baulked,
for none of my regular companions were there. It was beginning to be
ridiculous. I might as well have not known the Wargraves at all.</p>

<p>That evening I was very carefully early for my train, determined
that I would score then. My own set should now know first-hand what my
association with the young hero was. After all, what did those others
matter? But here again I had been forestalled.</p>

<p>"I met that man Barrington at lunch," said one of my neighbours,
"and he was most interesting about this young Wargrave. Knew lots of
things about his boyhood. Often stayed there. A ripping boy it seems
he was. Really, Barrington's not such a bad chap when you get to know
him. I think we must have him in our carriage now and then. He was
most modest about it."</p>

<p>"Did Barrington say that Lieut. Wargrave was a friend of his?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. No doubt about it; Barrington taught him to swim."</p>

<h2 class="sans">OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="title1">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

<p>Is not <i>Come Out To Play</i>
(<span class="smcap">Constable</span>) a delightful title for a story?
And, believe me, not better than the story itself, which I should
call, save for one defect, a perfect masterpiece in miniature. To have
done with blame, I will say at once that the defect is the end, which,
to my thinking at least, seems both inartistic and cowardly. I can
hardly explain my meaning more clearly without spoiling your
enjoyment. But I will hint that this tragedy of unfulfilled promise
(for the book is a tragedy, though concealed beneath a surface
merriment) seemed too delicate for so melodramatic a climax. Miss
<span class="smcap">M. E. F. Irwin</span> writes with an ease and
finish that is amazing. She has form, too, and a quite unusual beauty
of style that gives to her work something that is very difficult to
analyse. The book is the story of a boy called <i>Truffles</i> (which
of course was not his real name), a boy with a long white face and
dark eyes under heavy lids that gave him the look of Pierrot. Nothing
very special happens in his life. He has a genial spendthrift father,
a prig of an elder brother, a rather jolly sister and a host of
admiring friends. And the lot of them drift along in the artificial
comedy of London existence in peacetime, flirting and idling, working
and loving, all a little self-consciously; setting their emotions for
the most part to an accompaniment of popular comic songs, those
vacuous jingles whose light-heartedness Time so quickly turns to a
wistful and poignant melancholy. You will gather that the actual story
is no great matter. It is the faintly pathetic grace of the telling
that makes this book one of the very few to which the misused
adjective "beautiful" can honestly be applied. Perhaps in reading it
you may be reminded, as I was, of another modern novel, one that was
praised greatly in these pages and has leapt since to fame. I name no
names, because I am far indeed from charging Miss
<span class="smcap">Irwin</span> with imitation. The more present-day
writers who can display this same sensitive and compelling charm, the
better I shall be pleased.</p>

<hr class="mid" />

<p>The perfect children's-book must be one of the most difficult
things in the world to write. The qualities it would demand are so
varied and the dangers so many. You must, for example, be just
sentimental enough to obtain sympathy, yet never so much as to invite
suspicion of being sloppy. There must be adventure for the
adventurous, colour for the romantic and magic for everybody. Frankly
I cannot say that Mr. <span class="smcap">H. de Vere Stacpoole</span>
has achieved the ideal; but in <i>Poppyland</i>
(<span class="smcap">Lane</span>) he has certainly strung together a
number of stories that most children are sure to like. I fancy their
favourite will be "The Little Prince," a story in which all the right
things happen&mdash;beggar girls turn out to be Countesses, and handsome
Princes suffer a strictly temporary decline into beggary&mdash;and all in
an agreeable Neapolitan setting, which, as the advertisements say,
"will appeal to children of larger growth." With his fairies Mr.
<span class="smcap">Stacpoole</span> is, to my thinking, a degree less
successful. The worst of tales about storks and magic gardens and
cripple-boys and the like is that, however freshly you set forth,
sooner or later you are sure to find yourself in the foot-prints of
the old wizard of Denmark. If I had loved my <span class="smcap">Hans
Christian</span> less, I should have better appreciated certain tales
in this collection that inevitably recalled him. Still, the whole is
pleasant enough. I wish I could say also that I liked the
illustrations, but, with exceptions, these seemed to me both ugly and
pretentious. The best exception was one of the old stork, a delightful
piece of colour for the sake of which I can almost forget some of the
others.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span></p>

<hr class="mid" />

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Macnaughtan</span> always writes very
charmingly and with plenty of humour, and in dedicating <i>A Green
Englishman</i> (<span class="smcap">Smith, Elder</span>) to "My
Canadian friends" she must, I think, be too unconscious of her powers,
for this collection of stories is far from being a valuable
endorsement of the flowery praises of the emigration bureaux. Very
little hope is held out to the young man of good family who is a
gentleman and something of a sportsman, and proposes to pick up gold
on the pavements or the prairies of the West. I do not mean that the
writer is ungenerous either to the Dominion or to its people, but she
takes no pains to conceal the terror that lives with the beauty of its
vast spaces, and she does not represent the struggle to "make good" as
altogether a lovely thing. Perhaps the most ambitious of these
sketches, certainly the one which conforms most nearly to the "short
story" model, describes the fate of a clergyman's daughter who pays a
visit to Macredie, "somewhere on the C. P. R. line," and marries a
farmer and land-speculator, chiefly because this is her last chance of
marrying at all. The horror of the silence and the snow, when her
husband leaves her to face a Canadian winter alone, because he has
business in England, eventually drives her mad; and though most of the
stories are in a lighter vein than this, and there is plenty of the
humorous sentiment in which Miss
<span class="smcap">Macnaughtan</span> excels, the moral that I draw
from the book as a whole is, "Visit Canada by all means, but, unless
you are a Scotchman of the very doggedest type, don't stay there."</p>

<hr class="mid" />

<p>The hiding of lights under bushels may be all very well in private
life, but is misplaced in the book-publishing business. I thoroughly
disapprove of the title and the outside cover of the Hon. Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Dowdell's</span> latest collection of leisurely
essays, <i>Joking Apart</i> (<span class="smcap">Duckworth</span>).
The one suggests a heart-to-heart talk on the things that matter or
else an outburst of boisterous farce, while the other is merely
dismal. The two together are enough to put the public off a really
good thing. Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dowdell</span> treats of the
domestic and social side of feminine life in that peculiar vein of
humour which is neither joking nor yet joking apart; her writing
reminds me of those least-to-be-forgotten evenings of my life when I
have been lucky enough to listen for hours to a real pucker
conversationalist in the best of spirits and at the top of his form.
The words that passed are forgotten; it is even difficult to remember
what all the talk was about; but the recollection remains of having
heard the truth of things for once, neither laughed at nor wept over,
but very brightly revealed. Of twenty excellent chapters I much prefer
the one about woman's sphere in electioneering; as to the thumb-nail
illustrations in the margin, they show bad draughtsmanship, but some
are delightfully apt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lincoln Colcord</span>, writer of short
stories of the sea, republished under title <i>The Game of Life and
Death</i> (<span class="smcap">Macmillan</span>), has taken no pains
to conceal his admirable model. There surely never was, outside
conscious parody, so conspicuously derivative a method of handling
similar types and subjects. It was a bold thing to do. He has not
<span class="smcap">Conrad's</span> fastidious sense of words, nor
his masterly suggestion of atmosphere, so much more felt than actually
expressed, nor his patient sure unravelling of motives; and in "The
Voice of the Dead" he commits a piece of shocking bad Wardour Street,
of which by no conceivable lapse could his master have been guilty.
But there is a whiff of the sea in his work; his types, if cruder,
have life, and he often contrives some ingenious turn in the situation
which gives the story interest. <i>The Game of Life and
Death</i>&mdash;which ends in a hand of poker played between Chinese
merchants and pirates, with two lives and much money and gear for
stake&mdash;is a good yarn, though it leans on the inartistic unlikelihood
of a royal capping a straight flush&mdash;which is piling it on too thick.
The tale of "The Moths" that haunted a man who took them for the souls
of wronged women provides a sufficient thrill. "De Long" is just the
kind of story of the crooked cosmopolitan ship-chandler that
<span class="smcap">Conrad</span> would write, indeed has written.
<i>Nichols</i>, the narrator of this and others, is made after the
model of his reflective skippers. And here the challenge gets too near
for Mr. <span class="smcap">Colcord's</span> chances. Still the yarns
go well with a seasoned pipe; and that is no mean recommendation.</p>

<p><i>The Honourable Percival</i> (<span class="smcap">Hodder and
Stoughton</span>) may at least claim to have established a record in
one respect. I think I never met a full-sized novel with a more
slender plot. The <i>Honourable Percival Hascombe</i>, on a pleasure
tour in the Pacific, met <i>Miss Roberta Boynton</i>, and fell in love
with her. This, I give you my word, is all there is of it. But, if you
think that so slight a thread will be insufficient to hold your
interest, you reckon without the cunning of <span class="smcap">Alice
Hegan Rice</span>, who has spun it. There are those of us who worship
<i>Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch</i>. There are also those who
don't. But while regretfully classing myself among the benighted to
whom this Best Seller appealed in vain, I hasten to add that I have
nothing but gratitude for <i>The Honourable Percival</i>. This record
of a shipboard romance is done with the daintiest art, delicate,
tender, humorous, and not (as is the fault with so many American
romances) oversweetened. The development of <i>Percival</i> from a
priggish misanthrope to a man and a lover is beautifully told. Also a
great part of the charm of the tale lies in its setting, a series of
cinemascopic views of the ports touched at by the <i>S.S. Saluria</i>,
so vividly portrayed that you will close the book with quite the
feeling of the returned traveller. One small but poignant surprise the
ending has in store, which I will not spoil by anticipation.</p>
